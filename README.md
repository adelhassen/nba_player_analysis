### NBA Player Analysis

Thanks in part to the NBA’s skyrocketing global popularity and inflation, NBA players have seen a drastic increase in their salaries. For NBA teams, their spending is restricted by a salary cap. Teams must use their business acumen and barter favorable deals to sign top players while also staying within budget.

This interactive webpage alleviates some of the stress related to salary caps by allowing a user to analyze players’ performance and the price tag they do it for. It was built using Python Dash and Plotly. Using performance data of 20 NBA players from the 2018-2019 season, we conduct an analysis around determining the likely MVP Most Valuable Player) winner, identifying young players with high potential, and highlighting cost-efficient players. Five interactive figures are presented on the webpage including bar charts, scatterplots, and a table. Each figure focuses on a different aspect of a player’s performance and overall value.
